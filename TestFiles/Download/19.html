<description>Sports Illustrated writes about how teams competing in the NHLâ€™s Stanley Cup playoffs are using iPad to help. Theyâ€™re analyzing video, visualizing trends, scouting opposing players, preparing for games, and more â€” all using apps for iPad. Coaching staff can pull out an iPad during a game and use its information to guide players in a way not possible before. â€œThe ability to telestrate real-time on the iPad through the iBench app really allows us to not only show our players what is needed to succeed, but to teach our players how to succeed,â€ said L.A. Kings video coordinator Zach Ziegler.</description>

<title>iPad Writes a New Game Plan for Concussions</title>
<link>http://www.apple.com/your-verse/concussion-game-plan/?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
<description>To help diagnose sports-related concussions, Cleveland Clinic in Ohio is using an iPad app that can measure and monitor symptoms moments after an athlete gets hurt. With iPad and the C3 Logix app, trainers can visualize an injuryâ€™s effect on cognitive and motor performance, making it easier to spot a concussion. â€œIn the past, evaluating a concussed athlete involved a lot of guesswork,â€ says athletic trainer Jason Cruickshank, whose team is part of a program using this new technology. â€œiPad and the C3 Logix app have taken that subjectivity out of the process.â€ And injury assessments that previously required several pieces of equipment have now become simpler. â€œWe needed an acceleromater, a gyroscope, and a great display to be able to objectively test balance, vision, and reaction time,â€ Cruickshank says. â€œiPad gave us all of that in a single device.â€</description>

<title>iPad Elevates Mountain Expeditions</title>
<link>http://www.apple.com/your-verse/elevating-expedition/?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
<description>In exploring some of the worldâ€™s tallest and most treacherous peaks, one new piece of equipment has become essential to mountaineers Adrian Ballinger and Emily Harrington: their iPad. Instead of relying on paper maps to prepare for their expeditions, they study details of remote regions using iPad and the Gaia GPS topography app. â€œFive years ago, it was hard to even get a paper map of some of these places,â€ Ballinger says. â€œNow with the iPad itâ€™s remarkable how much we can plan ahead.â€ The climbers also use iPad to blog and post photos during an expedition instead of recounting their story when the trek is over. And iPad is an important tool during extreme weather, as Ballinger and Harrington rely on it to make sure they stay on track. â€œIn a whiteout,â€ says Harrington, â€œbeing able to see where you are on the mountain can be a matter of life or death. iPad is the only way to tell where weâ€™re going.â€</description>

<link>http://www.apple.com/education/real-stories/nanyang/?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
<description>Educators at one of Singaporeâ€™s top public high schools have found that using iPad in the classroom is helping students excel and changing the way they interact with their lessons. In 2011, Nanyang Girlsâ€™ High School launched a program to introduce iPad in the curriculum. The initiative began with a single grade level, but has since expanded to include the entire student body. â€œThe interactive features definitely appeal to and engage the students more,â€ says history teacher Ong Lee Hua. Students are speaking up more in class and participating more in online discussions. And teachers also say iPad helps the girls learn to navigate the collaborative world theyâ€™ll be working in. â€œThe collaborative element of using iPad is pretty relevant in todayâ€™s world,â€ according to language arts teacher Cressandra Tan. â€œNot just relying on your own strengths, but the strengths of your group.â€</description>
