<p class="story-body-text">RISHON LeZION, Israel &#8212; The Timesâ€™s Jerusalem bureau lost a loyal if not loved member last month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">It was an armored Mitsubishi Pajero, which saw action in the Balkans and survived the most violent year of the second West Bank intifada. It was more than 12 years old, and had logged 84,000 kilometers, or about 52,000 miles. The cause of death was crushing by boulder and iron claw. </p>
<p class="story-body-text">Irit Pazner Garshowitz, the bureau researcher who had been charged with care and feeding of the car for eight years, likened its last moments to a National Geographic documentary depicting an animal mauling its prey. â€œIt was brutal,â€ she said afterward. â€œShaken, Iâ€™m feeling shaky. Itâ€™s just a thing, though.â€</p>
<p class="story-body-text">The New York Times bought the Mitsubishi in 2009 for $1,000 from The Chicago Tribune, though it was valued at $100,000. The bargain was because it would have cost far more for The Tribune to remove the car from Israel, and it was expensive (and annoying) to maintain: If it was not moved several times a week, the battery would die, and replacing it cost $1,000 a pop. </p>
<p class="story-body-text">Those were some of the same reasons the Jerusalem bureau finally decided to let the Mitsubishi go. Also, West Bank violence has waned &#8212; I have not used the car since arriving in the region two years ago (the last time my colleagues ventured out in it to cover a demonstration, they could not unlock its door when stones started flying). Finally, Walt Baranger, who oversees equipment for The Timesâ€™s foreign bureaus, checked under the Mitsubishiâ€™s hood and declared it was not sufficiently armored for real confrontation anyhow.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">So Irit, who worked for The Tribune before joining The Timesâ€™s bureau, set about getting rid of it. CNN expressed interest, but transferring the car would have involved a two-day trip to Jordan. She suggested to Israeli customs officers that we donate the Mitsubishi to the military, perhaps for training, but officials said no. The authorities said our only option was crushing. And because my name was on the title, they said I had to watch.</p> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/05/15/the-jerusalem-bureau-says-goodbye-to-a-four-wheeled-combat-survivor/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-1145" class="more-link">Read&nbsp;more...</a>	</div>

	<p class="story-body-text"><em>Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, sent the following email to Times employees this afternoon announcing the appointment of Dean Baquet as executive editor.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text">Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p class="story-body-text">I am writing to announce a leadership change in the newsroom. Effective today, Dean Baquet will become our new executive editor, succeeding Jill Abramson. </p>
<p class="story-body-text">This appointment comes at a time when the newsroom is about to embark on a significant effort to transition more fully to a digital-first reality and where, across the organization, we are all learning to adapt to the rapid pace of change in our business.   </p>
<p class="story-body-text">We owe Jill an enormous debt of gratitude for positioning the newsroom to succeed on both of these critical counts and of course, for preserving and extending the level of our journalistic excellence and innovation. Sheâ€™s laid a great foundation on which I fully expect Dean and his colleagues will build.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">As those of you who know Dean will understand, he is uniquely suited to this role. He is a proven manager, both here at The Times and elsewhere. He is also a consummate journalist whose reputation as a fierce advocate for his reporters and editors is well-deserved.  And importantly, he is an enthusiastic supporter of our push toward further creativity in how we approach the digital expression of our journalism.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text">I know you will join me, Mark [Mark Thompson, the company's chief executive] and the rest of the senior leadership team in wishing Jill the best and congratulating Dean on his appointment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Arthur  </p>

Copy editors are one of the last lines of defense before an article is published in print or on the web.</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text">When a copy editor gets to work on an article for The Times, it doesnâ€™t matter what section its for, the guiding principal is the same one new doctors embrace when they take the Hipocratic Oath: First do no harm.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">If I were an editor looking at the opening sentence of this piece, though, I might be tempted to harm my head by banging it a few times on the desk. Letâ€™s start with the glaring factual mistake: â€œFirst do no harmâ€ is nowhere to be found in the oath. The ancient Greek physician may have written those words, or something like them, but he did not put them in the oath, despite what is commonly believed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">And while weâ€™re at it, that â€œitsâ€ should be â€œitâ€™s.â€ That â€œprincipalâ€ should be â€œprinciple.â€ And it should be â€œHippocratic,â€ with two â€œPs.â€ And isnâ€™t the whole thing a little long? And maybe a clichÃ©? And â€“ sorry to be a stickler â€“ but isnâ€™t the reference to â€œancient Greek physicianâ€ in the second paragraph an example of what The New York Times stylebook frowns on as indirection (â€œsidling into facts as if the reader already knew themâ€)?</p>
<p class="story-body-text">At this point, the writer may also be banging his head on the desk. Wait â€”  I <em>am</em> the writer. Ouch!</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Fortunately, most of the stories that have come across my desk in my 15 years at The Times are in a lot better shape than that.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Copy editors are basically one of the last lines of defense before articles are posted on the web or put in the paper. We try to make sure that a story is factually accurate, balanced and grammatical. Weâ€™re also responsible for making sure it complies with The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage. And we write headlines and captions. </p>
<p class="story-body-text">By the time an article gets to us, it has usually been read by the assigning desk, known here as the backfield. A reporter may have been asked to rewrite some or all of it. And if it is a high-profile article, it has probably been read by any number of other editors up and down the masthead  â€” all of whom are happy to share their own ideas.</p> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/05/12/the-copy-desk-the-end-of-the-gauntlet-or-is-it-gantlet/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-1103" class="more-link">Read&nbsp;more...</a>	</div>

<p class="story-body-text">Last year I got a tip from a friend who is a college-admissions officer about the rising number of application essays her school was receiving about money, social class and work. As someone who is engaged in a yearslong effort to get people talking about money more often, I wanted to encourage this trend. I also desperately wanted to read them myself, so I asked readers to send them in. We published four last year and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/your-money/four-stand-out-college-essays-about-money.html">have just put up four more.</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text">But hereâ€™s what I had forgotten entirely: I was one of those money-essay-writing kids, too.<br />

<p class="story-body-text">One of the biggest decisions we make every week at the Book Review is: What will be on the cover? Most weeks, there is a standout novel or work of nonfiction or an extremely commanding review by a prominent author or critic that demands attention. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/donna-tartts-goldfinch.html">Stephen King on Donna Tartt&#8217;s &#8220;Goldfinch,&#8221;</a> for example. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/elizabeth-gilberts-signature-of-all-things.html">Barbara Kingsolver on Elizabeth Gilbert&#8217;s &#8220;Signature of All Things.&#8221;</a> Or we group a few books together, as we did last week with three biographies about James Madison, John Quincy Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams.<br />

<p class="story-body-text"><em>What does a Times columnist do in a slow political season? Plenty. Our Op-Ed columnist Gail Collins discusses how curiosity, humor and the occasional obsession keep the gears of topical commentary turning. She was interviewed by Peter Catapano, an editor in Opinion.  </em></p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text"> Thereâ€™s no time like the present. Whatâ€™s on your radar now? Anything political?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">This is a tough time for my corner of the commenting business. Congress isnâ€™t doing anything, the president is in his second-term doldrums and voters arenâ€™t focused on the fall elections yet.  Of course there are always random moments that remind us why we were put on earth to write about politics. New Jersey bridges are inexplicably jammed; ranchers whose cows graze free on government land rebel against the government.  So columnizing goes on. But weâ€™re still in a drought. If things get any worse, Iâ€™ll have to revert to my treasure trove of anecdotes about <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/williamhenryharrison/GailCollins">William Henry Harrison.</a></p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">Speaking of midterm elections, they may be six months away, but the campaign drumbeats will begin before we know it. Do you dread election seasons or look forward to them? </p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">I absolutely adore election season. Itâ€™s so much easier to talk about the issues when thereâ€™s a big contest.  Itâ€™s like â€œWheel of Fortune,â€ except instead of vowels, thereâ€™s education and health care and womenâ€™s reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">On a purely selfish level, I like election years because I get to go to places Iâ€™ve never been before. If it wasnâ€™t for Senate races past, Iâ€™d probably never have gotten to North Dakota, which I liked very much. Iâ€™m down to seven states Iâ€™ve never visited, and this year Iâ€™m definitely eyeing West Virginia.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">Itâ€™s hard to believe youâ€™ve never been to West Virginia.</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">Well, Iâ€™ve driven through, but my rule is that doesnâ€™t count.

<p class="summary">One-on-one interviews with Times journalists.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text"><em>Kyle Crichton is a regional editor for Russia and Iran on the International Desk. He has coordinated The Times&#8217;s coverage of the Ukraine crisis. We asked him about the planning behind the coverage and the impact of President Vladimir V. Putin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/europe/Putin-Russia-Ukraine.html">statement Wednesday</a> that Russian troops were pulling back from the Ukrainian border.<br />
</em></p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">How many reporters have been in on the coverage of the Ukraine crisis? </p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">That varies according to the news. At the height of the revolution, from Feb. 21 for the next several weeks, until the Crimea occupation calmed down, we had about five or six people in the country and at least one or two in Moscow.  </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">Where they have been based?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text">Usually in the wrong place, it seems. Well, not really. We had two in Kiev when that was the center of developments, plus at least one in Crimea, one in Lviv and one or two in the east â€” Donetsk and, later, Slovyansk. This week we&#8217;ve been keeping Andrew Kramer in Odessa on the theory that it is the most likely place to explode on Friday, when we expect pro-Russian people to march in celebration of Victory Day, the celebration of the defeat of the Nazis. Now, with President Putin&#8217;s statements about withdrawing troops from the front lines with Ukraine and urging separatists to call off their referendum on sovereignty, that isn&#8217;t looking as likely.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text"> How have you shaped coverage? What reporting targets seem most important right now?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text"> The greatest long-term potential for a major development is the southeast, of course, where the threat of a Russian invasion has hung over everything, but that may be changing after Putin&#8217;s remarks. </p>
<p class="story-body-text">The challenge for us is to cover the news in a way that gets under the surface. We did that on Sunday with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/world/europe/behind-the-masks-in-ukraine-many-faces-of-rebellion.html">Chris Chivers&#8217;s piece </a>on one of the militant cells in Slovyansk, the pro-Russian stronghold. We have also focused on Russia&#8217;s mind games, its intense propaganda war and its game of warning against violence while doing its best to stoke it. Also, the broader East-West ramifications of the crisis.</p> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/05/07/ukraine-behind-the-coverage/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Q&amp;A&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-1002" class="more-link">Read&nbsp;more...</a>	</div>
