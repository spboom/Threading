        <p class="story-body-text">Some facts, according to a recent Womenâ€™s Media Center <a href="http://wmc.3cdn.net/2e85f9517dc2bf164e_htm62xgan.pdf">study</a>:</p>
<p class="story-body-text">* At the nationâ€™s 10 most widely circulated newspapers, men had 63 percent of the bylines, nearly two for every one for a woman.  (The study looked at bylines only in the first section of the papers.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text">* Among those papers, The Times had the biggest gender gap â€“ with 69 percent of bylines going to men.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">* Women are far more likely to cover health and lifestyle news. Theyâ€™re less likely to cover crime, justice and world politics.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">* At three major papers, including The Times, and four newspaper syndicates, male opinion-page writers outnumber female writers four to one.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">After three decades in journalism, I find it hard to believe that â€“ while things have changed radically in some ways â€“ thereâ€™s still such a gender imbalance. At the <a href="http://www.journalismfestival.com/">International Journalism Festival</a> in Italy earlier this month, I was part of a panel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvzJeoFbI28">â€œWhere Are the Women?â€</a> Sitting there, discussing the paucity of women in journalism leadership globally I had a surreal feeling: Are we really still talking about this?</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Separately, Philip N. Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, has done <a href="http://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/gender-nytimes/">an interesting analysis</a> of gender and bylines for 30,000 recent New York Times articles.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text">Back in the office last week, I chatted with <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/janet_elder/index.html">Janet Elder</a>, a deputy managing editor, about the Women&#8217;s Media Center report, what the numbers mean and how much things have changed for women in journalism. Ms. Elder, the second-highest-ranking female editor in the newsroom after <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/jill_abramson/index.html">Jill Abramson</a>, the executive editor, told me that while thereâ€™s still plenty of room for improvement, the culture of The Times is much different now.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">â€œThereâ€™s been a pretty dramatic change,â€ she said. She recalled a time about 20 years ago when she was in meetings with, perhaps, 25 men and two women.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">These days, not only is the top editor a woman â€“ the first &#8212; but many department heads and section editors are, too. The Washington bureau chief is Carolyn Ryan; the culture editor is Danielle Mattoon; the national editor is Alison Mitchell; the book review editor is Pamela Paul. And of the 10 top-ranking editors at The Times, five are women. In addition to Ms. Elder and Ms. Abramson, they are Susan Chira, Rebecca Corbett, and Michele McNally.</p> <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/still-talking-about-it-where-are-the-women/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-6149" class="more-link">Read&nbsp;more...</a>	</div>

"><div class="ad sharetools-inline-article-ad"></div></div>
        <p class="story-body-text">Mistakes are inevitable. So, too, are newspaper corrections, since newspapers are full of those pesky things known as facts and are produced by human beings, who have a tendency to get things wrong sometimes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">But some mistakes are bigger than others, and this was the case in two related columns by <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/joenocera/index.html">Joe Nocera</a> about <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/warren_e_buffett/index.html">Warren Buffett</a>, chairman of <a href="http://topiâ€™â€˜cs.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/berkshire_hathaway_inc/index.html">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, concerning sky-high executive compensation at Coca-Cola, where Mr. Buffett is the largest shareholder. In short, Mr. Buffett thinks executive compensation is out of whack; he <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/at-berkshire-annual-meeting-questions-for-buffett-about-coca-cola-and-deals/">abstained</a> from voting to approve it at Coca-Cola but did not vote against it, as some thought he should have done, including Mr. Nocera.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">(Disclosure: From 1999 to 2012, I was the editor of <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com">The Buffalo News</a>, a paper owned by Berkshire and of which Mr. Buffett is the chairman. I own no shares of Berkshire.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text"><!-- more --></p>
<p class="story-body-text">Mr. Nocera made some serious factualÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/opinion/nocera-buffett-punts-on-pay.html">errors</a> in those columns, particularly in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/opinion/nocera-buffett-changes-his-tune-on-pay.html">the second one</a>, in which he also took Mr. Buffett to task, calling him â€œcowardly and hypocritical.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text">After a complaint from Mr. Buffett, which I was sent a copy of, corrections were appended to the columns, and published in print. Â (One correction, however, was left out. Â In his first column, Mr. Nocera referred to Mr. Buffett as a member of the Coca-Cola board; that hasn&#8217;t been true for eight years. That error was never formally corrected, although it gets a mention in the second column, in which, remarkably, Mr. Nocera uses his own original error to bash Mr. Buffett further: &#8220;He should be embarrassed. Itâ€™s actually worse than I had realized. My original assumption was that Buffett didnâ€™t want to offend his fellow board members, especially those on the compensation committee, who had vouched for the equity plan. But Buffett left the board in 2006.&#8221;)</p>
<p class="story-body-text">But there&#8217;s a much bigger problem. The entire premise of the second column is built on a mistake: that Mr. Buffett had changed his tone after â€œlicking his woundsâ€ over the reaction to statements he made on April 23, including Mr. Noceraâ€™s criticism. As Mr. Nocera told it in the second column, after several days of this embarrassment passed, Mr. Buffett decided to â€œbite backâ€ by going on the offensive in a Fortune interview on April 28.</p> <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/warren-buffett-joe-nocera-and-fessing-up-to-readers/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-6114" class="more-link">Read&nbsp;more...</a>	</div>

        <p class="story-body-text">         Times readers, especially those who comment frequently on articles, often ask me to explain how members of that special class known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/usercontent/verified/verified-commenters.html">verified commenters</a> get their stripes (or their check marks, to be more precise). The comments of these 478 readers are posted without going through the Timesâ€™s moderators â€“ about a dozen people who read comments and decide whether they should be posted. The idea is to expedite the process of getting at least some comments posted, which also lowers the overall number of comments that need moderation in advance.<br />

        <p class="story-body-text">         The Times led its print edition Monday with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/world/europe/photos-link-masked-men-in-east-ukraine-to-russia.html">an article</a> based in part on photographs that the State Department said were evidence of Russian military presence in popular uprisings in Ukraine. The headline read: &#8220;Photos Link Masked Men in East Ukraine to Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text">And the article began:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text">For two weeks, the mysteriously well-armed, professional gunmen known as â€œgreen menâ€ have seized Ukrainian government sites in town after town, igniting a brush fire of separatist unrest across eastern Ukraine. Strenuous denials from the Kremlin have closely followed each accusation by Ukrainian officials that the world was witnessing a stealthy invasion by Russian forces.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Now, photographs and descriptions from eastern Ukraine endorsed by the Obama administration on Sunday suggest that many of the green men are indeed Russian military and intelligence forces â€” equipped in the same fashion as Russian special operations troops involved in annexing the Crimea region in February. Some of the men photographed in Ukraine have been identified in other photos clearly taken among Russian troops in other settings.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text">More recently, some of those grainy photographs have been discredited. The Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/world/europe/scrutiny-over-photos-said-to-tie-russia-units-to-ukraine.html?ref=todayspaper">published a second article</a> backing off from the original and airing questions about what the photographs are said to depict, but hardly addressing how the newspaper may have been misled.<br />

<p class="story-body-text">This one, from Heidi Reich, a public school teacher in New York State, is a response to Sundayâ€™s front-page article on the education standards known as Common Core.   This was also the subject of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/opinion/brooks-when-the-circus-descends.html">David Brooks column</a> last week.  Reader mail has been heavy on the subject, mostly expressing unhappiness with how the opposition to the standards has been depicted as political, rather than because of their <a href="http://dianeravitch.net/2014/04/20/why-doesnt-the-new-york-times-understand-the-controversy-over-common-core/">flaws as educational tools</a>.

It has mortgage troubles, you see. It has onerous legal costs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">â€œThe disappointing news shows how Bank of America is still paying for its mortgage problems nearly six years after the financial crisis,â€ the article said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">I thought of sending a small check to help or at least conveying my sympathy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">I really should have remembered what this is all about because it was <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/bank-of-america-to-pay-6-3-billion-to-settle-mortgage-securities-suit/">only last month</a> that Bank of America settled a lawsuit that claimed the bank had committed mortgage fraud. The cost of the settlement? More than $9 billion. Bank of America was one of the banks that sold mortgage securities backed by subprime mortgages, which went south during the housing and financial crises â€“ in many cases driving American consumers into financial ruin.<br />

        <p class="story-body-text">        Do the Pulitzer Prizes still matter?  Do they stand for anything except journalistic self-congratulation?  The question comes up every year around this time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text"><a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/node/8501">Mondayâ€™s awards</a> caused celebrations in quite a few newsrooms, including at The Times, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-new-york-times-sweeps-photography-pulitzers/2014/04/14/17c13da2-c42f-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html">which swept the photography categories.</a>  (Print readers will find a very attractive layout of the winners on page A19 today; itâ€™s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/business/media/coverage-of-snowden-and-boston-attack-win-pulitzer-prizes.html?ref=media#slideshow/100000002824474/100000002824476">available online</a> as well.  And <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/the-new-york-times-wins-two-photography-pulitzers/">The Timesâ€™s Lens blog</a> gives a sense of the stories behind the remarkable photojournalism.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text">The announcements undoubtedly caused some depression in other newsrooms and for other journalists; a quip Iâ€™ve heard in the past few days, tied to the timing of this yearâ€™s awards announcement, is that â€“ for some &#8212;  every year is â€œpassover.â€</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Iâ€™ll offer these observations, based on my experience as a four-time Pulitzer juror and a former member of the Pulitzer board, which makes the final decisions on the prizes.  (I stepped down after a one-year stint as a condition of taking my current job as public editor.)<br />

        <p class="story-body-text">        Many Times readers, some of whom have Type 1 diabetes, are upset over <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/health/even-small-medical-advances-can-mean-big-jumps-in-bills.html?_r=1">an article last Sunday</a> in which Elisabeth Rosenthal explored the often extraordinary expense of treating the disease.   It was an installment in her series, â€œPaying Till It Hurts,â€ about the high cost of medical care in America.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">In emails, on blogs and on Twitter, the readers have harshly criticized what they see as the way the article trivializes the treatments and devices that are crucial to their lives or those of their family members.  In response to the articleâ€™s mention of â€œhigh-priced gadgets and disposable accoutrements,â€ they are using a Twitter hashtag: #notjustagadget.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Over the past few days, I have read much of the criticism, including that on two blogs: <a href="http://www.diabetesmine.com/2014/04/new-york-timeson-diabetes-costs.html">Diabetes Mine</a> and <a href="http://asweetlife.org/feature/the-cost-of-staying-alive-with-diabetes-a-response-to-the-new-york-times/">A Sweet Life</a>, both of which make points worth considering.   I have reread the article itself, many of the reader comments on it, and spoken to the articleâ€™s author and to its main editor, Rebecca Corbett.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Iâ€™ve also become aware of the key role that several industry-backed patient-advocacy groups have played in heating up the protests.<br />

        <p class="story-body-text">        The New York Times led its print edition today with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/business/sliver-of-medicare-doctors-get-big-share-of-payouts.html">an extensive treatment</a> of an important story:  that a small fraction of doctors get a huge share of the billions of dollars paid out under Medicare.   </p>
<p class="story-body-text">Whatâ€™s missing in that story is any reference to The Wall Street Journal, whose persistent legal efforts over several years helped result in a trove of Medicare data being made public, including much of the data that Wednesday&#8217;s news reports were based on.  Many news organizations treated the findings as a big news â€“ the story  also appeared on The Journal&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303456104579490043350808268?mg=reno64-wsj&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303456104579490043350808268.html"> front page</a> and that of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/data-uncover-nations-top-medicare-billers/2014/04/08/9101a77e-bf39-11e3-b574-f8748871856a_story.html">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/09/government-releases-medicare-physician-payment/7462923/">USA Today.</a> (The Post, USA Today and  <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/database-some-docs-getting-millions-medicare">The Associated Press</a> also did not credit The Journal by name.)<br />
